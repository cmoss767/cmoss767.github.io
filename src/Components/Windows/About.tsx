        I'm Chris Moss, a software developer with a background in vaccine
        research. I've coded on and off since 2018 but I finally decided to take
        the plunge into programming as a career in 2022. I currently work at
        Code and Trust and I love learning about new technologies and building
        out cool projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my free time I enjoy hiking, cycling, cooking, and playing tennis.
